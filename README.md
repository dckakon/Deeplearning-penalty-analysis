YOLOv4 was initially used on a custom-created video dataset to detect the goalkeeper, kicker, football, and goalpost. Following that, OpenCV was used to track the football and divide the goalpost into four zones. To track the kicker’s body positioning data, pose estimation was used. After recording the data for posture estimation, an LSTM model was utilized to recognise a footballer’s activity. The dataset contains 1560 numpy files with a total of 205920 pose landmarks from pose estimation.
