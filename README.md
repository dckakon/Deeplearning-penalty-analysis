YOLOv4 was initially used on a custom-created video dataset to detect the goalkeeper, kicker, football, and goalpost. Then, OpenCV was used to track the football and divide the goalpost into four zones. Pose estimation was used to track the kicker’s body positioning data. After recording the data for posture estimation, an LSTM model was utilized to recognize a footballer’s activity. The dataset contains 1560 numpy files with a total of 205920 pose landmarks from pose estimation.
